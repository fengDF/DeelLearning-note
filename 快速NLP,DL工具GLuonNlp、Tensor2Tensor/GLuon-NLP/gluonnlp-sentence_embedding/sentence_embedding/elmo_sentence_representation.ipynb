    "# Extract Sentence Features with Pre-trained ELMo\n",
    "\n",
    "While word-embeddings have been shown to capture syntactic and semantic information of words and have become a standard component in many state-of-the-art NLP architectures, their context-free nature limits their ability to represent context-dependent information.\n",
    "Peters et. al. proposed a deep contextualized word representation method, called Embeddings from Language Models, or ELMo [1].\n",
    "This model is pre-trained with a self-supervising task called bidirectional language model, and they show that the representation from this model is powerful and improves the state-of-the-art on many tasks such as question-answering, natural language inference, semantic role labeling, coreference resolution, named-entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show how to use the model API in GluonNLP to automatically download pre-trained ELMo model, and generate sentence representation with this model.\n",
    "We will focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) how to process and transform data to be used with pre-trained ELMo model, and\n",
    "2) how to load the pretrained ELMo model, and use it to extract representation from preprocessed data.\n",
